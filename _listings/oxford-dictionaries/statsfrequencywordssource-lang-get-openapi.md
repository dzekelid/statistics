  title: Oxford Dictionaries Retrieve a list of frequencies of a word/words derived
    from a corpus.
  description: |-
    This endpoint provides a list of frequencies for a given word or words. Unlike the /word/ endpoint, the results are split into the smallest units.   To exclude a specific value, prepend it with the minus sign ('-'). For example, to get frequencies of the lemma 'happy' but exclude superlative forms (i.e., happiest) you could use options 'lemma=happy;grammaticalFeatures=-degreeType:superlative'.   Parameters can be provided in PATH, GET or POST (form or json). The parameters in PATH are overriden by parameters in GET, POST and json (in that order). In PATH, individual options are separated by semicolon and values are separated by commas (where multiple values can be used).   The parameters wordform/trueCase/lemma/lexicalCategory also exist in a plural form, taking a lists of items. Examples:
    * PATH: /wordforms=happy,happier,happiest
    * GET: /?wordforms=happy&wordforms=happier&wordforms=happiest
    * POST (json):
    ```javascript
      {
        "wordforms": ["happy", "happier", "happiest"]
      }
    ```
     Aside from individual frequency requests, users can also post a list of items for which they would like to get frequencies. The list has to be uploaded in json and the required fields are "items" and "collate".   The field "items" is a list of items for which you want the frequencies. The content of the items depends on the option for "collate". The value of "collate" should be a list of "columns" that the items contain. The list is limited to combinations of "wordform", "lemma", "trueCase" and "lexicalCategory". The fields that are listed in the "collate" options have to be present in each item. Here are some examples of queries:
    * ### Get frequencies of provided wordforms:
    ```javascript
      {
          "collate": ["wordform"],
          "items": [{"wordform": "test"}, {"wordform": "Test"}]
      }
    ```
    * ### Get frequencies of provided lemmas:
    ```javascript
      {
          "collate": ["lemma"],
          "items": [{"lemma": "test"}, {"lemma": "Test"}]
      }
    ```
    * ### Get frequencies of provided lemmas per lexical category:
    ```javascript
      {
          "collate": ["lemma", "lexicalCategory"],
          "items": [
              {"lemma": "test", "lexicalCategory": "verb"},
              {"lemma": "test", "lexicalCategory": "noun"}
          ]
      }
    ```

      summary: Retrieve the frequency of ngrams (1-4) derived from a corpus
      description: |-
        This endpoint returns frequencies of ngrams of size 1-4. That is the number of times a word (ngram size = 1) or words (ngram size > 1) appear in the corpus. Ngrams are case sensitive ("I AM" and "I am" will have different frequency) and frequencies are calculated per word (true case) so "the book" and "the books" are two different ngrams. The results can be filtered based on query parameters.   Parameters can be provided in PATH, GET or POST (form or json). The parameters in PATH are overriden by parameters in GET, POST and json (in that order). In PATH, individual options are separated by semicolon and values are separated by commas (where multiple values can be used).   Example for bigrams (ngram of size 2):
        * PATH: /tokens=a word,another word
        * GET: /?tokens=a word&tokens=another word
        * POST (json):

          ```javascript
            {
                "tokens": ["a word", "another word"]
            }

  /stats/frequency/word/{source_lang}/:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve the frequency of a word derived from a corpus.
      description: |-
        This endpoint provides the frequency of a given word. When multiple database records match the query parameters, the returned frequency is the sum of the individual frequencies. For example, if the query parameters are lemma=test, the returned frequency will include the verb "test", the noun "test" and the adjective "test" in all forms (Test, tested, testing, etc.)   If you are interested in the frequency of the word "test" but want to exclude other forms (e.g., tested) use the option trueCase=test. Normally, the word "test" will be spelt with a capital letter at the beginning of a sentence. The option trueCase will ignore this and it will count "Test" and "test" as the same token. If you are interested in frequencies of "Test" and "test", use the option wordform=test or wordform=Test. Note that trueCase is not just a lower case of the word as some words are genuinely spelt with a capital letter such as the word "press" in Oxford University Press.   Parameters can be provided in PATH, GET or POST (form or json). The parameters in PATH are overriden by parameters in GET, POST and json (in that order). In PATH, individual options are separated by semicolon and values are separated by commas (where multiple values can be used). Examples:
        * PATH: /lemma=test;lexicalCategory=noun
        * GET: /?lemma=test&lexicalCategory=noun
        * POST (json):

          ```javascript
            {
              "lemma": "test",
              "lexicalCategory": "noun"
            }
          ```

         One of the options wordform/trueCase/lemma/lexicalCategory has to be provided.
