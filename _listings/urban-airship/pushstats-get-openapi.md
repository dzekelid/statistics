  title: Urban Airship Get Push Stats
  description: 'Returns hourly message counts for your application. By default, results
    are returned in JSON. For CSV, either add the header:Accept:text/csv or append
    &format=csv to the query string. Times are in UTC, and data is provided for each
    push platform (currently: iOS, BlackBerry, Android, and C2DM, in that order).
    The statistics system is updated every 15 minutes, so the final count for an hour
    will be done at the latest 15 minutes after the hour is done.'
