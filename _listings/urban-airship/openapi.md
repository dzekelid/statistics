      description: 'Returns hourly message counts for your application. By default,
        results are returned in JSON. For CSV, either add the header:Accept:text/csv
        or append &format=csv to the query string. Times are in UTC, and data is provided
        for each push platform (currently: iOS, BlackBerry, Android, and C2DM, in
        that order). The statistics system is updated every 15 minutes, so the final
        count for an hour will be done at the latest 15 minutes after the hour is
        done.'
